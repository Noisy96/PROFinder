# PROFinder App
## The problem! :confused:
My fellow students often ask for a certain professor's email address, on either facebook groups of group chats and this has been going on for the entire 3 years I've spent there, and I wanted to try JavaScript's frontend framework __React JS__
<img src="https://github.com/Noisy96/PROFinder/blob/master/images/react-logo.png" width="25"> so bad! Soo...

## Description
Minimalist single purpose mail directory web app... basically an enhanced document + (Ctrl+F) exprience. Cool hein??? :zany_face:

## The lesson!
I finally got myself to define a scope for the v1 and not go way beyond it (which oftentimes lead to not releasing at all), I usually want something perfect from the get-go and every developer out there knows that that's unrealistic, you gotta be able to balance some technical debt instead of trying to completely eradicate it.
